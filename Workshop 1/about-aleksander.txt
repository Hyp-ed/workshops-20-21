Hi guys! I'm Aleksander (but you can call me Alex) and I'm a 2nd year Mechanical Engineering student
all the way from northern Poland. 
Inspired by Meina to talk about my linguistic skills, kann ich Englisch, Spanisch, Polnisch und naturlich Deutsch sprechen. 
Last year, at HYPED, I was a member of the Power team where I mainly focused on the High-Voltage system and took care of the BMS (Battery Management System). 
Why did I decide to join Software this year? On my 1st year of studies I took 2 CS courses (Haskell+Java) and that only made me realise
what a mistake I made not to apply for CS as my major! Not to waste all the programming skills I've learned, I decided to 
contribute to software team's goals this year and learn some new exciting things! When it comes to my interests, I'm the 
"sports-guy". Since I remember, I've benn windsurfing, playing tennis, football, basketball, american football, volleyball,
trained skiing, boxing, karate and I still am not sure that I've listed everything I've tried. 

P.S.
"How I met your mother" is the greatest sitcom ever and don't even try to change my mind cause that won't happen.
