Hello!:) My name is Meina. I'm a second year AI & CS student from Mauritius - a teeny-weeny island off the Southeastern coast of Africa.
I'm fluent in both English and French (If you can speak French, feel free to chat with me in French :D)
I enjoy meeting new people and learning about their country/culture.

I joined HYPED in 2019 as a Sensor Software Team member, so this is my second year in HYPED.
I learned quite a lot of stuffs (Git to start with) and met some amazing people while being in the society.

I hope you will be able to enjoy it as much as I do!
Looking forward to work with you all. Cheers!:)

~Meina
