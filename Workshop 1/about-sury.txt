Hi!
My name is Suryansh (Sury), a 2nd year direct entry student studying pure Comp Sci.
Last year I did a year long internship at a medical robotics company based in Cambridge,
which was pretty awesome!

I like table tennis (although I may not be amazing at it), and am interested in data
science and more analytical based computer science.
