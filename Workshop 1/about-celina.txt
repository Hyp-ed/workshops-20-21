Hey! I'm Celina and I'm currently in my fourth year of AI and CS. I'm from the Basque Country (Spain) and I'm a foodie, which is not very surprising considering the Basque Country has some of the best food in all of Spain. I love surfing in my spare time, and recently got into boxing.

I just joined HYPED this year, thinking I would have a lot of free time given the pandemic restrictions regarding socialising... I will be working remotely from Spain, but I'm really looking forward to meeting people within the society and learning C++ (I don't like pointers, so we'll see how that goes).
